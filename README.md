"# reversing-demo" 
This repository contains the source code of the binary 64-bit ELF binary which was used during the I-Talent reverse engineering demo.

Compile the source code into a binary without optimizations:
```
gcc pxldemo.c -o -O0 pxldemo
```

When it's compiled you can make it an executable:
```
chmod +x pxldemo
```

To run the executable:
```
./pxldemo
```
